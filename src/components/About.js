        <p> I'm a South Florida native and life-long Florida Panthers fan.  
          I have a deep love for Jazz and am a fairly accomplished guitar player - although there is always more to learn.

        <p>
          Lately, I've taken up MERN Stack Web Development and am just starting to find my groove - I hope you'll follow me on this journey
